          <h2>Overview of the Course Registration System</h2>
          <p>
            The Course Registration System is designed to facilitate student registration, course management, and instructor handling within a web-based interface. The system connects to a relational database to store student, course, and instructor data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system has a simple user interface made up of HTML forms that interact with the backend via server-side logic. The web interface handles user requests, such as enrolling students, adding instructors, and dropping courses, while the backend processes and stores the data in a database.
          </p>
